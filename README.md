# DAPT Classification
Study on Draw-a-Person images classification

In this study, a unique dataset of 1000 hand drawn images were collected during Draw-a-Person test. The images are original sketches of the children on plain sheet. The dataset were manually classified to 8 classes according to their mental ages by the professionals in this field. Some machine learning, deep learning and computer vision test were conducted to train the computational device to classify the images automatically. Several papers were published as the result of the study. We hereby release the dataset to the community, as it needs further studies to imrprove the classification accuracy (65%) achieved by the author, Ochilbek Rakhamanov, by using novel algorithm called CKP. We also share the preprints of the published papers to help to visitors to understand the done experiment.
